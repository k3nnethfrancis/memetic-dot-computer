Description:  Discover the ultimate guide to creating and managing a successful side hustle, from concept to profit, and learn how to turn your passion into a fulfilling extra income stream.", "completion": "guide: how to side hustle (21st century edition)\n\nThe first thing you need to do before you start a side hustle is figure out if you are the founder type\nYou can read my post to find out if you are the founder type however, if you are considering a side hustle, you probably are\nThe hard thing about side hustles is that for a while you’re not gonna make any money\nWow, that isn’t always the case. Most people struggle to figure out how to build something people want and get their first customers.\nFor most people, this takes its experimentation and iteration\nI for example, have been playing the side hustle game for at least 3 to 5 years in total. I’ve maybe about $5000 in extra cash.\nThere is still some good news, though fur one you only need to figure out what people want once to have sustainable business to it is far easier to do this today with all the AI tools at your disposable then it was five or 10 years ago\nI no longer think knowing how to code is a basic requirement of being an Indy founder however, it certainly still helps a lot. this isn’t because coding is a requirement it is, but now you can outsource that work to AI that said there is a certain type of thinking and reasoning that one learns through learning to code that they can apply to the types of thinking, and reasoning problems required to solve, when you are starting your own business\nthat said, even if you don’t have these skills, it is still possible to start your own business prior to AI people started their own businesses without meeting to learn to code however, this often means needing to outsource some skill set such as building website or setting up some sort of internal tool to help you do the work that you need to do to run your business\nOutside of any technical skill requirements or gaps the main thing that you need to start a side hustle is patience, dedication and determination along with a willingness to eat shit and keep going. You may try many different things and you may fail many different times, but as I mentioned before, you may only need to succeed once.\nThe hardest part from my perspective is needing to balance a full-time job on the side. I think what’s unfortunate about the idea of being a founder is that it’s accompanied by this idea that you must be willing to make almost or exactly no money for an indefinite period of time and live in poor living conditions to be able to go on this journey, I don’t think that’s true, but I certainly think it is more difficult to do when you are not full-time focused on trying to build a business but as a man with the AI things have gotten a lot easier in fact they’ve gotten so easy that if you are at all the type of person that wants to be a founder then you probably should because the benefits of having a successful business outweigh the safety net you get with working a full-time corporate job.\nSo how do you get started?\nfirst, the most important thing is finding a problem to solve. I know this is cliché because in virtually every piece of start up advice this is what you will read and the reason is because it is absolutely correct and there really is no other way to think about it.\nHowever, however, the problem you are solving doesn’t have to be someone else’s problem. It could be your own problem. Also, the problem you were solving may not necessarily be thought of as a problem however, be careful for solutions in search of a problem.\nIt is tempting to start from ideas, and in fact, I think starting from ideas reveals a fundamental truth about human nature, and it’s one that really ought to consider starting our own business\nstarting businesses is hard it will probably be the hardest thing that you do so if you are going to do it might as well be doing something that you love because if you don’t love that thing, you work on it for a really long time, you may get tired of it and you may give up when times get tough\nI think the sweet spot for starting a business is solving your own problem when you solve your own problem you’re solving something that came from an idea that you had yourself. It is a hybrid between your own ideas and a problem that is likely to exist for someone else, further you as the initial user are intimately aware of the problem and space associated with that problem therefore, you are uniquely positioned to solve it\nParticularly when it comes to side hustle businesses the ones that you would like to become full-time businesses solving your own problem is a particularly good fit\nThe first side hustle my first real start up that I had on the side was solving a problem in an industry that was new to me. It was a cool industry, and I liked it. It created a new problem for me in order to solve the problem effectively I had to go out and I had to talk to people in that industry to learn about the problem more intimately so I could solve it more effectively, I had to spend lots of time focused on customers when my time was already limited\nDon’t get me wrong you should always be focused on customers, but when you are your own customer, it can save you the trouble of having to learn about an entire industry and the problem that you were trying to solve when your time is limited\nstill today, I speak from a place of naivety maybe we’ll see my first startup is still on its search for customers, but the lessons I learned allowed me to come up with this new formula and type up this first starting new businesses because the mistakes I made with this start up help me see how to avoid them in the future and that’s why I’m sharing them here\nThe new formula looks something like this step one experiment with things that interest you in on your craft and your ability to build out visions in the early days, you are building the skill set for building at this point you’re not really aiming to solve a problem you’re flexing your muscles and building the ability to build solutions\nThe second step is to analyze the work that you have done here. What problems did you run into? Was there anything that you had to solve on your own because there wasn’t an existing solution? If so, this might be a great place to start. If not, you can start thinking about problems that you have and flexing those skills for building solutions on solving those problems.\nyou should always aim to initially solve problems with the most simple solution. The reason is twofold one business is a constant iterative feedback loop. The first solution will never be the final solution second, You don’t know when whether you’re solution is good or not until you test it so you should build test as soon as possible if you can test it with other people who have the problem in addition to yourself and get feedback that’s an even better place to be\nOnce you have a solution built out, it is time to distribute since you’re still early you are still in the discovery phase. This is also why it’s important for your solution to be simple so you could quickly make changes and they’re not large sunken cost with the solution that you built.\nIt’s great that the solution is something for you. It’s still important from a business perspective that you get feedback from others who have that problem.\nA great way to find people who have a problem is Reddit. Simply search for the type of problem or the industry and see which posts and celebrate it. Come up. Comments, original posters, and other comments to see if they are willing to try your solution.\nOn your first iteration, you don’t need to talk to 100 people especially if you are your own customer but it’s useful to talk to at least four or five after getting feedback from about four or five people. You can decide what improvements to make to your product.\nat this point, you may improve your product or you may need to entirely change the solution. This is perfectly normal and is a big reason why these things can take so much time. It is very hard to be right all the time in business however there is an intuition that you can grow, and it is particularly easy to do that when you are intimately aware of your problem much harder to do so when you have to learn that from existing customers that said it is doable either way\nYou gonna continue this process for several iterations and the main objective after about the first iteration is to attempt to sell the product\nnow, if you are working on a product that is solving your own problem this I think is a good strategy. However, if you are working on a product that is solving someone else’s problem I highly suggest you sell that product before you build it. This is a very hard thing to do, but if you can manage it, then you know for certain that you have a product worth building is far too easy to convince yourself that the product that you want to build is worth building because people are too nice and they won’t tell you the truth about your product or solution. The only way to get the truth out of people is to make money part of the equation.\nThe only exception to this rule is solving your own problem and being your own customer, but be sure that the solution you build is truly something you would use yourself. You are solving your own problem. You should be solving it and using the product if you are not, why would you expect anyone else to do it?\nselling a product that is in the MVP stage or a product that has not yet been built at all is not an easy thing however it does something very important because people who are willing to put money on the line for a product that barely works or doesn’t exist are people who have a burning problem and you want to solve burning problems because this is the easiest path to product market fit. All other paths are loaded with pain while selling at this stage is a painful process that takes a unique skill set which you will probably have to build. It is far less painful than spending months or years building a product that no one wants to use, unfortunately this is the reality for many startup founders\nto avoid this, it can be helpful to set up timelines and milestones for your startup ideas. e.g., if i dont get 1 customer in 3 months i move onto the next thing. this can help avoid sunk costs prisons and increase the variance of ideas you work on in a given year, which will ultimately increase the chances of something working \nso here is the formula again:\ndevelop skills for building solutions\nfind a problem to solve, ideally your own\nif not your own problem, try to sell it before building it\nif your own problem, build the simplest solution possible that you would use yourself\nget feedback and try to sell\ntry to talk to at least 5 people per week\nif you can’t sell the product in 3 months time, pivot to a new problem\n\n\nthe final caveat that i want to reiterate is the value of passion. different problems will have different requirements for skills and build times. for example, the minimum viable timeline for a simple saas app might be a few weeks to months but a new drug discovery paradigm might take years. you will need to use judgment to determine how much time to assign to a given problem. for problem solution sets that may take a long time to validate, passion is crucial. if you are a chemist by trade you probably don’t want to spend 6 months working on a new kind of smart dog leash (maybe you do, but my guess is you don’t). and if you decided to do that, it may get hard to continue pushing forward after a few months. this is another reason why working on your own problems is important, but generally, your passion is what is going to drive you to success. if you imagine all of the most successful startup founders you can think of, how many of them were not passionate about what they are doing? passion is the drive that motivates the most successful people — i think it is a crucial ingredient in building successful startups.\nif you can manage to do all of this while working a full-time job, you have done one of the hardest parts. after your first customers you have two choices: continue bootstrapping or go after funding. what the right answer is depends on you and your startup. you may consider angel funding to have just enough to quit your job — or you may go right to the accelerator or VC route. Each of these has their pros and cons which are out of the scope of this post. The good news is, you’ll have options, because once you’ve started getting customers, you’ve done the most important thing from the eyes of any investor: you made some money.\nnothing will get you easier from here on out, but you’ll finally be free from the schackles of the 9-5 and be able to put your full time focus into your passions. this, i think, is what life is all about.\n"}

It describes a product of evolution where human consciousness reflects an increasingly connected hive mind – a sort of thought biosphere.\nI find the noosphere interesting because it represents the stage of evolution where consciousness as we know it is no longer a singular phenomenon. One of Teilhard's points, however, is that it never really was.\nFrom atoms and molecules to the necessary configurations required for life – at what point in the evolutionary process does consciousness emerge?\nIn some ways, this is the Sorites paradox applied to the evolution of mind.\nIn Teilhard's view, consciousness is the product of evolution's increasing complexity. And through science and technology, humanity becomes capable of collective knowledge and organization on a global scale. This capability [as was the result of cellular complexity leading to conscious humans] is what catalyzes the emergence of the noosphere.\nFor a book written almost a century ago, Teilhard's views feel remarkably familiar to what is happening with the internet today.\nAt the edge of the web3 revolution, new methods of human coordination have emerged. At the same time, DeSci builds the scientific hyperstructures of the future.\nWe may still be early on in this chapter of the human story, but I am personally convinced that this is the technology Teilhard prophesied.\nDAOs represent the next phase of human evolution towards the noosphere."}

Some of which are tackling the world's most pressing problems. Web3 builders are constructing robust, viable alternatives to broken legacy systems—block-by-block—in what is beginning to look a lot like a revolution.\nIf DeFi wasn't the tipping point, NFTs revolutionizing the creative economy certainly was. It brought tens, if not hundreds of thousands of new entrants to the space. Many of which have since gone down the rabbit hole, only to discover an entirely new realm of possibilities for blockchain. Now, the latest emergent property of the ecosystem is DeSci, and it's on a mission to revolutionize science.\nWelcome to the digital renaissance\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, an entanglement of artistry and wealth led to an explosion of innovation. For one of the first times in history, diverse European cultures were coming together to share their creations and ideas. As a result, the renaissance quickly became a philosophical movement, leading to scientific and technological breakthroughs.[^1]\nGalileo invented the telescope during the renaissance, which allowed the field of astronomy to blossom into the discipline it is today. The microscope, which revolutionized how we study microbes, bacteria, and disease was a renaissance invention. And one of the most notable inventions of the renaissance—possibly of human history—was the printing press, which allowed us to greatly scale access to knowledge, drastically influencing the development of modern civilization.\nIt's all happening again.\nAn infusion of art and wealth, catalyzed by NFTs, has taken the internet by storm. People from all corners of the globe are sharing ideas about how web3 can change everything.\nA new world philosophy is taking shape.\nDeSci is yet another example of how these movements spread. A branching off—if you will—of the macro-movement into micro-communities with their own sub-cultures and visions for how web3 can shape the future.\nAt the rate I've seen things going, DeSci won't stay micro for long. Just like the telescope, the microscope, and the printing press became the canonical tools of their trade; eventually, all artists will use NFTs. Eventually, all scientists will be part of DeSci.\nThe truth is in the fundamentals\nArtists need to make a living and have struggled with problems related to copyright, authenticity, and fair compensation. NFTs solve this.\nScientists need intellectual freedom and have struggled to break free from the multi-billion dollar publication system that has imprisoned them, hemorrhaging scientific progress. DeSci solves this.[^2]\nThe NFT is to art what the IP-NFT is to DeSci. A legally binding NFT with IP rights embedded in metadata. IP-NFTs enable scientific developments, like an algorithm or the discovery of a drug, to be licensed for use under rules set by a community of scientists rather than a for-profit organization. But IP-NFTs are just the tip of the iceberg.\nAt talentDAO, we're building the first decentralized scientific publishing protocol for the social sciences. We'll leverage the DeSci community to govern the peer-review process and integrate reputation and identity protocols to ensure accountability and equity remain central to the scientific process.\nAt the same time, DeSci Labs is building Nodes, a tool for scientists to mint their work to the on-chain scientific record. By replacing the PDF standard with a dynamic research artifact that acts as your repository, [e.g., pre-print, data, code, etc.] they're enabling verifiability and reproducibility across an enormous breadth of scientific disciplines.\nVirtual labs are a personal favorite of mine. I've been watching from the sidelines as LabDAO leads the charge on building a decentralized digital workspace for scientific experimentation, which is desperately needed for collaboration in the digital era.\nAnd because tokens enable individuals and organizations to fund science projects directly and without restrictions, DeSci represents a new level of scientific freedom that was previously impossible under the existing infra.[^3]\nEven as early as we are right now, with most DeSci DAOs hovering at ~1 year old, the new world philosophy behind the digital renaissance continues to spread.\nMoonDAO may be the first DAO to attempt decentralized rocket science. They've raised millions to democratize access to space with plans to open source the rocket and satellite tech they develop—something I believe is critical to the equitable growth of the space economy.\nOpen source is core to the new world philosophy adopted by those building in web3. It's no surprise to see it echoed throughout DeSci. While the open science movement has been slow to gain traction, web3's ability to realign incentives could change that.\nOpen source as behavior\nThe idea behind open source is simple: some information [or collection thereof] is made freely and publicly available for others to utilize and build upon. This could be some source code, a book, instructions for how to build a motorcycle or anything in between.\nAt its core, open source is about sharing knowledge and resources—behaviors that are critical components of innovation.\nConsider Bell Labs in the 1950s: computing pioneers like Richard Hamming were involved in tech communities where knowledge and resource sharing were the norm. To have the best machine possible to run his compute-intensive models, Hamming would coordinate with a community of technologists to rent out a shared one.[^4]\nEventually, Bell Labs found it cheaper to get Hamming his own machine, but the very act of sharing high utility resources to advance scientific and technological progress seems to be fundamental to how we achieve it. Today, some of the most fundamental tech in your personal computer was once a Bell Labs experiment.\nRenting out a computer may not exactly be open source, but what matters is the presence of knowledge and resource-sharing behaviors in these communities. Bell Labs was known for an idea-rich culture that stimulated its inventiveness.\nThe presence of these behaviors in DeSci at least partially explains why the movement can seem so attractive to scientists. Sharing knowledge and resources for others to utilize and build upon is exactly how we achieve scientific progress. If that doesn't explain it, consider how the current scientific system has strayed from this idea, while most scientists have not.\nCall me crazy, but I have a hunch that what's coming out of the early days of decentralized science may very well be seen as revolutionary in a few decades from now.\nUpholding the scientific system\nEven with the complex challenges that come with decentralized organizing, I'm beginning to think it's a big reason why we're so rapidly innovating. What is lost in productivity is gained in ingenuity.\nOne quickly learns in this space that software isn't the only thing that needs decentralizing. DeSci needs decentralized hardware too. Complex scientific work requires GPU clusters designed to run resource-intensive computing processes like protein folding, genetic sequencing, and training neural networks—some of the most important scientific work of our time.\nWhen members of the community begin donating their hardware for the cause, it's an indicator you're onto something worth building. I'm lucky enough to experience this in my own work collaborating with the LabDAO ML team on Project Lion.\nTypically, the compute required to run complex scientific models is not accessible to the average individual. Chip shortages today make this a greater challenge. By offering up their GPUs to the community, other scientists can leverage the compute to run their own models in a virtual lab, much like Hamming and his colleagues rented hardware to run theirs. This idea is still early, and its not entirely novel, but the sentiment is powerful.\nIn a win-win for science—the researcher runs her model and the donor gets to contribute to scientific progress.\nBut this also emphasizes another core ideal of the new world philosophy: members of the community operate their own nodes to uphold the network.\nThis same ethos extends into DeSci, where community members operate their own hardware to uphold the scientific system.\nI'm excited to see more of this behavior as DeSci moves to becomes the macro-movement it's poised to be.\nWhile web3 isn't without its flaws, its the first reasonable strategy I've heard for fixing science. To see it through, we'll have to keep innovating; sharing our ideas, resources, and learnings with one another. The scientific system is one of the most fundamental elements of a functioning society, decentralized or otherwise. Rebuilding it will take a village.\nNotes\n[^1] Severy, Merle Thomas B Allen; Ross Bennett; Jules B Billard; Russell Bourne; Edward Lanoutte; David F Robinson; Verla Lee Smith, The renaissance – maker of modern man, 1970\n[^2] Philipp Koellinger, Christian Roessler, Christopher Hill, Why we need to fundamentally rethink scientific publishing, 2021\n[^3] E.g., Gitcoin, SCRF, and OceanDAO; more significantly, DAOs can launch their own tokens to raise money for scientific work.\n[^4] Richard Hamming, The Art of Doing Science and Engineering, 1997"}

It doesn't have to be someone else's problem; it can be your own. Just make sure it's not just an idea - solve a real-world problem.\n\n**Step 2: Build, Test, and Repeat**\nBuild a simple solution, test it with others who have the same problem as you, and gather feedback. Then, refine your product based on what people say. Don't be afraid to pivot if needed.\n\n**Step 3: Sell Your Product (Even If It's Not Perfect)**\nYou don't need a perfect product to sell. Just make sure it solves a real problem for others. Use Reddit or other platforms to find people who have the same issue as you.\n\n**Step 4: Get Feedback and Refine**\nTalk to at least five people per week, gather feedback, and refine your product accordingly. Don't be discouraged if things don't work out right away - it's a process.\n\n**The Formula**\n\nDevelop skills for building solutions\nFind a problem to solve (ideally your own)\nBuild the simplest solution possible that you would use yourself\nGet feedback and try to sell\nTry to talk to at least five people per week\nIf you can’t sell the product in three months, pivot to a new problem\n\n**The Final Caveat**\nPassion is crucial. If you're not passionate about what you're doing, it'll show in your work. And remember, working on your own problems is often the best way to start.\n\nSo, if you can manage to do all this while working a full-time job, you've done one of the hardest parts.

{"prompt": "Expand on this summary of 'Non Sense': ", "completion": "non-sense\nmany of the places you’ll work in the world will fire you for being irrational. for many jobs, the bar is literally to bring logical and coherent reasoning to the table. in practice this usually looks like “look to the data” or at the very least, “make it make sense”.  but some things are non-sense. and no, this isn’t nonsense.\nthere is a class of solutions to problems that are nonsensical in the traditional sense, which means they defy the normative laws of logic and reasoning.\nif you present a solution to a problem at work that follows sound logic and reasoning, your boss will applaud you and, if it doesn’t work out, you’ll get a pat on the back and a “we’ll get ‘em next time.” but rarely will you get fired when everyone agrees with your reasoning. conversely, if you had a ridiculous idea like “let’s change our domain name and raise prices” when your goal is to increase sales, you might be laughed out of the room. not only so, but if you did it anyway, and it failed, you may very well get fired for it. only, research shows that this kind of psycho-logic is exactly the right kind of thinking. where as the conventional logic would have said, to simply drop prices.\nthe problem is business logic is a fork of economic models of supply and demand, value and loss. but human decision making is rarely rational in the ways economic models posit. the decisions humans make are rational insofar as they are aligned with their internet beliefs, but they often defy conventional logic pushed by economists.\nin fact, some of the worlds most innovative ideas were originally seen as insane. but they worked. the problem in business is the incentives (often to be risk averse rather than risk seeking) are not designed to enable risk taking. bad decisions get punished when they do not align with conventional wisdom, leaving almost no room for innovation. this only gets worse as business become calcified in their bureaucracy.\nthe difference between nonsense and non-sense is that one of these things is truly illogical and the other only seems so based on conventional wisdom. the idea of psycho-logic is that we break the conventional wisdom of the economists and begin looking at the world from the lens of a psychoanalyst.\nthis way of thinking is inherently risky \nthe problem with conventional economic models and risk averse thinking is that it operates under the normative model of human reasoning — that is, everyone else is thinking the same way as you. \nbut if you want to stand out in the world or be innovative in your business strategy you must think differently. you cannot follow the same logical process as any other human or else wind up in the same places as them, with the same boring ideas that don’t work, but get your boss to sign off and ultimately, keeps your job.\nthe kind of thinking we need more of in the world is the opposite. the non-normative, non-sensical thinking where trying new things, no matter how wild they may seem is allowed. because we often have the reasoning process backwards. we like to first think of the reasoning then think of the solution. but instead we should do things like the great innovators of humanity have, they didn’t reason about problems, they guessed and tried different things. when something finally worked, it was only then when science and logic had a place in the procedure of explaining the the hell just happened."}
