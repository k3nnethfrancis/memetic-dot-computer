{"text": "<s>[INST] Expand on this summary of 'Extended Mind':  [/INST]\nwork systems and the extended mind\nAs it turns out, On information technology was a discussion of the extended mind hypothesis.\nThis is the idea that the mind is not limited to the inside of the head. But rather, we leverage systems and tools to extend our minds outside of the head, into the world.\nConsider the following thought experiment:\nSuppose you and a friend are meeting for coffee. Your friend remembers that the coffee shop is on Smith Street, so he hops in his car and drives himself over. You've been to the coffee shop before, but it's been a while, so you'll need to look it up on your phone first. Once Google Maps reminds you of its location on Smith Street, you hop in your car and drive yourself over.\nIs there any relevant difference between the mental states you and your friend arrived at?\nBefore answering this, let's first define a mental state: a condition of the mind which has content, typically expressed in \"that\" statements, corresponding to thoughts and feelings.\nFor example, the belief that I am writing, the desire that I convey this information clearly, or the intention that I publish this in May.\nFrom mental states, we are able to arrive at a proposition–an attitude, argument, theory, proposal, etc., which may lead to actions[1].\nIn our thought experiment, both parties arrive at the same mental state–the belief that the coffee shop is located on Smith street. Of course, there are differences in the way that mental state was reached, but that is less a matter of mental state than it is a matter of vehicle.\nAll mental states need vehicles–a means to arrive at said mental state. In conventional philosophy (i.e., the identity thesis), the vehicles of mental states are neural states. For the extended mind hypothesis, vehicles can exist outside of the mind: a notebook, a smartphone, or another information system.\nThe extended mind hypothesis says that the vehicle in which you arrive at a mental state makes no difference. All that matters in defining a mental state is that it functions as one. This is known as the parity principle and is a fundamental argument for functionalism.\nFunctionalism posits that mental states are mental states regardless if they arise from flesh or metal or silicon. This is interesting because it leaves open the possibility that, in the future, machines will have mental states of their own.\nGiven the recent advancements in computing and artificial intelligence, it is important that we have a philosophy that can account for the possibility of machines not just passing the turning test but, by way of function, have beliefs, desires, and intentions of their own.\nIf functionalism is true, there is no reason to believe that mental states coming from within the head are fundamentally different from mental states that arise from outside the head. They play the same role in cognition.\nIn his paper, Neuroethics and the Extended Mind, Neil Levy goes on to suggest that not all information technologies can be classified as vehicles of mental states. He argues that 1) Wi-Fi isn't always available and 2) the latency between our brains and those systems isn't efficient enough. Yet in the decade since the paper was published, we've significantly reduced that latency.\nInternet connection speed in the United States from 2007 to 2017 (in Mbps)\nStarlink satellites will soon be available worldwide with the potential to provide internet to everyone, anywhere. And in the not-so-distant future, we'll experience the world through brain-machine interface technology, where that latency will cease to exist.\nAlthough we aren't there yet, I would argue that information technology today largely serves as a vehicle of the extended mind. It may not serve people of all kinds, in all contexts, but it does for many.\nMost of us leverage information systems every day to make decisions about our life and work. I for one, could not do my job effectively without them.\nJust like in the thought experiment when you leveraged Google Maps to remember the coffee shop's location, I use Google search to remember syntax for code I write. If my intention is that I have working code, does it matter the vehicle I use to get there?\nNow, consider this same idea but at scale: systems of people utilizing information technology as an extension of mind.\nOrganizations with well-leveraged information systems have the foundations for collective intelligence; an extension of social interactivity and interconnected processes among networks of human nodes. Like an organizational hive mind, the social and technical subsystems[2] of a larger work system have the potential to synthesize.\nThe most effective organizations in the future of work will learn how to make this happen.\nFootnotes:\nActions are not mental states but are often the result of them.\nThe social subsystem refers to the division of labor and methods of coordination used to transform inputs into outputs in an organization. The technical subsystem refers to the tools, systems, and procedures used in that organization's transformation process.</s>"}

{"text": "<s>[INST] Complete the passage: epochs of open science The coordination layer of the internet is expanding. DAOs are sprouting up everywhere. Some of which are tackling the world's most pressing problems. Web3 builders are constructing robust, viable alternatives to broken legacy systems—block-by-block—in what is beginning to look a lot like a revolution. If DeFi wasn't the tipping point, NFTs revolutionizing the creative economy certainly was. It brought tens, if not hundreds of thousands of new entrants to the space. Many of which have since gone down the rabbit hole, only to discover an entirely new realm of possibilities for blockchain. Now, the latest emergent property of the ecosystem is DeSci, and it's on a mission to revolutionize science. Welcome to the digital renaissance In the 15th and 16th centuries, an entanglement of artistry and wealth led to an explosion of innovation. For one of the first times in history, diverse European cultures were coming together to share their creations and ideas. As a result, the renaissance quickly became a philosophical movement, leading to scientific and technological breakthroughs.[^1] Galileo invented the telescope during the renaissance, which allowed the field of astronomy to blossom into the discipline it is today. The microscope, which revolutionized how we study microbes, bacteria, and disease was a renaissance invention. And one of the most notable inventions of the renaissance—possibly of human history—was the printing press, which allowed us to greatly scale access to knowledge, drastically influencing the development of modern civilization. It's all happening again. An infusion of art and wealth, catalyzed by NFTs, has taken the internet by storm. People from all corners of the globe are sharing ideas about how web3 can change everything. A new world philosophy is taking shape. DeSci is yet another example of how these movements spread. A branching off—if you will—of the macro-movement into micro-communities with their own sub-cultures and visions for how web3 can shape the future. At the rate I've seen things going, DeSci won't stay micro for long. Just like the telescope, the microscope, and the printing press became the canonical tools of their trade; eventually, all artists will use NFTs. Eventually, all scientists will be part of DeSci. The truth is in the fundamentals Artists need to make a living and have struggled with problems related to copyright, authenticity, and fair compensation. NFTs solve this. Scientists need intellectual freedom and have struggled to break free from the multi-billion dollar publication system that has imprisoned them, hemorrhaging scientific progress. DeSci solves this.[^2] The NFT is to art what the IP-NFT is to DeSci. A legally binding NFT with IP rights embedded in metadata. IP-NFTs enable scientific developments, like an algorithm or the discovery of a drug, to be licensed for use under rules set by a community of scientists rather than a for-profit organization. But IP-NFTs are just the tip of the iceberg. At talentDAO, we're building the first decentralized scientific publishing protocol for the social sciences. We'll leverage the DeSci community to govern the peer-review process and integrate reputation and identity protocols to ensure accountability and equity remain central to the scientific process. At the same time, DeSci Labs is building Nodes, a tool for scientists to mint their work to the on-chain scientific record. By replacing the PDF standard with a dynamic research artifact that acts as your repository, [e.g., pre-print, data, code, etc.] they're enabling verifiability and reproducibility across an enormous breadth of scientific disciplines. Virtual labs are a personal favorite of mine. I've been watching from the sidelines as LabDAO leads the charge on building a decentralized digital workspace for scientific experimentation, which is desperately needed for collaboration in the digital era. And because tokens enable individuals and organizations to fund science projects directly and without restrictions, DeSci represents a new level of scientific freedom that was previously impossible under the existing infra.[^3] Even as early as we are right now, with most DeSci DAOs hovering at ~1 year old, the new world philosophy behind the digital renaissance continues to spread. MoonDAO may be the first DAO to attempt decentralized rocket science. They've raised millions to democratize access to space with plans to open source the rocket and satellite tech they develop—something I believe is critical to the equitable growth of the space economy. Open source is core to the new world philosophy adopted by those building in web3. It's no surprise to see [/INST]\nit echoed throughout DeSci. While the open science movement has been slow to gain traction, web3's ability to realign incentives could change that. Open source as behavior The idea behind open source is simple: some information [or collection thereof] is made freely and publicly available for others to utilize and build upon. This could be some source code, a book, instructions for how to build a motorcycle or anything in between. At its core, open source is about sharing knowledge and resources—behaviors that are critical components of innovation. Consider Bell Labs in the 1950s: computing pioneers like Richard Hamming were involved in tech communities where knowledge and resource sharing were the norm. To have the best machine possible to run his compute-intensive models, Hamming would coordinate with a community of technologists to rent out a shared one.[^4] Eventually, Bell Labs found it cheaper to get Hamming his own machine, but the very act of sharing high utility resources to advance scientific and technological progress seems to be fundamental to how we achieve it. Today, some of the most fundamental tech in your personal computer was once a Bell Labs experiment. Renting out a computer may not exactly be open source, but what matters is the presence of knowledge and resource-sharing behaviors in these communities. Bell Labs was known for an idea-rich culture that stimulated its inventiveness. The presence of these behaviors in DeSci at least partially explains why the movement can seem so attractive to scientists. Sharing knowledge and resources for others to utilize and build upon is exactly how we achieve scientific progress. If that doesn't explain it, consider how the current scientific system has strayed from this idea, while most scientists have not. Call me crazy, but I have a hunch that what's coming out of the early days of decentralized science may very well be seen as revolutionary in a few decades from now. Upholding the scientific system Even with the complex challenges that come with decentralized organizing, I'm beginning to think it's a big reason why we're so rapidly innovating. What is lost in productivity is gained in ingenuity. One quickly learns in this space that software isn't the only</s>"}

{"text": "<s>[INST] Explain this point from the blog post 'Governing The Red Planet': Blockchain technology provides four core features: distributed systems, digital currency, immutability, and tokenization. [/INST]\ngoverning the red planet\nImagine the year is 2199.\nIt’s been nearly two centuries since the first humans arrived on Mars. The people of Earth have since constructed launch sites, underground scientific labs, and production facilities that operate within an economy of their own. The Mars colonial system is on the verge of self-reliance.\nAs a neutral territory dedicated to the expansion of human civilization, the red planet is governed by a diverse community of colonists who operate without a centralized authority. Colonists are empowered to vote on issues facing the colony and the people of Earth are included in decisions that pertain to humanity. Interplanetary trade and communication are a core part of the Earth-Martian relationship.\nFor people on Earth, the high-risk high-reward asteroid mining industry presents an appealing reason to make the journey. A colonist's family back on Earth would be well cared for thanks to the industry's outsized returns. For the people of Earth, Mars is the Silicon Valley of the 2190s.\nFor many colonists, however, the most appealing factor is the chance at a fresh start—to build a better world for humanity. A world where software enforces decentralized governance at scale, enabling a self-sovereign colonial ecosystem where progress finally gets the incentive structure it deserves.\nThis is the story of MartianDAO.\nAn old problem\nToday, a reasonable debate on the feasibility of colonizing Mars would inevitably arrive at an economic standoff.\nThe most obvious question is, \"how do we pay for it?\"\n…except ‘we’ really means ‘the government,' making things political.\nWhat we ought to be arguing instead is whether governments should be the primary decision-making authority for the future of our civilization.\nAfter all, if Mars is to be a human endeavor. Should it not represent human ideals?\nPolitics blind us from seeing the possible world where governments are not the only funding mechanism for Mars colonization.\nBut the reality is, until now, it was not previously possible to support the kind of collective action and money pooling system needed for this to be a truly planetary effort.\nThis is a seemingly simple requirement on the surface, but a wicked problem under the hood.\nNot only do we need a system for pooling resources and making collective decisions on a planetary scale, but the first task of designing this system leaves humanity in a paradox: how does a society design an economic system that must create and follow its own set of rules without a centralized authority maintaining order?\nAnd if that isn't problematic enough, to be truly fruitful, the system must incentivize continued contributions without creating an unfair monopoly or granting any one party too much control.\nSociety has conditioned us to believe that this type of self-organizing, decentralized system is not possible; that humans are not capable of working together in such a way, never mind at such a scale.\nIf recent history has taught us anything, however, it’s that technology has a funny way of changing the world.\nMartianDAO\nSolving the problem of funding and allocating Mars financials is, of course, not the only thing that makes colonization hard. But without it, nothing else is possible. And there are some clear problems to address.\nIn my view, the path towards achieving the Martian state outlined in the introduction of this essay [let's call it the Martian ideal] is best taken with a decentralized blockchain protocol [^2], effectively making the Mars colonial system a DAO.\nBlockchain provides four core features that make the Martian ideal possible:\nA distributed system: the underlying technology is run on many computers working together to uphold the network.\nDigital currency: money that can be stored and transferred over the internet without a mediating party.\nImmutability: transactions are listed on-chain forever. We can see where they come from, where they go, and where they are held.\nTokenization: the ability to create tokens that can be assigned a value and grant holders certain utilities.\nWhile many other features of a blockchain like non-fungible tokens [NFTs] and on-chain voting mechanisms would be important aspects of the ecosystem as a whole, it is these four core features that make everything else possible.\nAt the foundation, a distributed network of computers ensures the system is resistant to attack and without a need for centralized control. Nodes verifying the network can be built into almost any piece of technology we might use on Mars. Digital currency empowers colonists to transact both with other colonists and the people of Earth efficiently and with minimal bureaucratic restrictions. Immutability ensures accountability, authenticity, and enables public verification. Tokenization extends beyond programmable currency to enable far broader utility and incentives.\nThe rules of the protocol\nGovernance and tokenomics represent the rules of the protocol.\nGovernance defines how decisions are made while tokenomics define the monetary policies of the system. These rules are programmed into smart contracts.\nWhile governance and tokenomics are separate concepts, in a mature system, they would be highly interrelated.\nLet’s consider an example: imagine a law on Mars where colonists pay a land tax. Tokenomics would define how the tax is calculated and could automatically collect by verifying the non-fungible deed to the land in the owner's wallet. If colonists wanted to change the tax rate, governance would define that process with a procedure for submitting a proposal to be voted on by other colonists.\nWhen voting on a proposal, voters will need to consider the optimal amount of decentralization to achieve the Martian ideal. [^1] For example, requiring a 51% majority to change the rules.\nThe ideal governance system may require some experimentation, and system designers must think in terms of centuries–not decades–because the system must include features with implications for the future of Martian civilization such as incentive structure and wealth distribution. As a hedge, developers can program a reset into the Martian constitution after a given number of years has passed. [^2]\nThe process of reviewing and voting on initial proposals at a planetary scale will be one of the most difficult but necessary parts of this process to reach an equitable outcome. This initial method of constitutional proposals is the idea of metagovernance—\"the rules that make the rules.\" [^3]\nOnce a design has been selected, only then should a system be devised for pooling resources that:\n\nallows anyone to contribute\nis capable of interplanetary transfers [^4]\nenables participation in the Martian governance process\n\nPooling money prior would place unnecessary pressure on early contributors.\nWhile the goal is to create a decentralized system, there must be strong enough incentives for people to contribute in the first place. Without an economic incentive motivating behavior, only those with an intrinsic desire to go to Mars will have any vested interest in the state of the Martian colonial system.\nConsider that if MarsCoin is the reserve currency on Mars and the colony becomes self-sustaining and prosperous, it should attract investors and more colonists, pushing up its value. In this model, the same technology that allows you to exchange capital for resources on Mars can be used to invest in the mission as well.\nAdding utility to a token to complement its central purpose as a currency is one of the most promising things about cryptocurrency. For example, we could design a system where voting power is a function of the amount of MarsCoin one purchases. Alternatively, we could take a retroactive approach to incentivize engineering by airdropping a separate class of governance tokens after users make contributions to the system. [^5] In fact, we could develop as many derivatives of MarsCoin as we need, each with a different purpose, like stablecoins or reputation tokens, each of which could add value to the ecosystem in its own ways.\nThe limits for a well-tokenized system to incentivize progress might seem endless, but designing digital infrastructure underlying a planetary socioeconomic system can have unintended consequences. Tokenomics must be considered with absolute scrutiny if the goal is to achieve [and maintain] the Martian ideal.\nIt is far more difficult to fix an unjust system than it is to design one that is just to begin with.\nWhile there are many pitfalls in tokenomics designs that can go unforeseen before a system reaches critical mass, governance is the critical factor for maintaining decentralization in the long run. And the list of governance pitfalls is no shorter.\nWe should take lessons from current experiments and their outcomes. ENS for example implemented a governance system where one can delegate their votes to a trusted party, but when a few trusted parties maintain a majority of votes, we are effectively centralizing the system.\nMoreover, if governance and tokenomics are too intertwined, such that power is too closely correlated with the total amount of MarsCoin one holds and there are no measures in place to cap one’s governance power, we may risk centralized parties emerging with a disproportionate amount of decision-making power. This is contradictory to the ideals of decentralization.\nAddressing this is difficult. Because of human nature, there may always be conflicting and communal interests that lead to lobby-like behavior. However, since not everyone can physically contribute, it will be hard to incentivize financial contributions without putting some weight on monetary contributions as a path to having a say in humanity’s future.\nLuckily, in a world of programmable money, distributive justice is just a few more lines of code.\nSome ideas:\n\nA colonist-contributor split: for every MarsCoin minted on the blockchain, an additional MarsCoin is minted into a locked Martian treasury. These coins will ensure that colonists always have 50% governance power, but the coins will never be used for making transactions to retain supply scarcity.\nGovernance utility caps: no matter how many coins an individual entity holds, they will never be granted more than 5% of the available voting power.\nStochastic parliament: using a random number generator, parliament members could be nominated at random from the colony. The colony could then choose who they’d like to delegate their governance tokens to over the term, which would then be locked until the following term.\n\nI'm by no means an economist and there are far better ideas out there. It’s probably a smart decision to avoid designing a system where the reserve currency is tied to policy-making decisions in the first place. But maybe not always. I simply aim to demonstrate how different incentive mechanisms can be built into a systems design.\nThere are limitless possibilities for designing the hyperstructures that power the Martian ideal. This kind of smart-contract-based system would run forever, for no cost other than the energy to run the network, without maintenance or downtime.\nWhat’s beautiful about this system is that in the future, if there is majority agreement, it can be updated. To change the rules of society with a pull request is a revolutionary way to change the world.\nDAOs' unique applications further extend to the way they reward their members. Decentralized finance [DeFi] protocols enable novel reward mechanisms like staking, while NFTs can be used to unlock token gated rewards for their holders. Staking works by locking up your investment within a protocol. In return, you're offered interest for providing the protocol liquidity.\nStaking could offer a unique way for colonists and contributors to leverage their capital while ensuring enough liquidity to keep critical projects moving.\nThe asteroid mining industry could leverage NFTs to grant a stake in certain asteroids on the belt. These asteroids are to some degree a gamble, but a lucky draw could mean generational wealth.\nThen, asteroid NFT holders could stake their asteroids to effectively lease them out to miners. They could then mine them for resources while owners are paid out in fees.\nThis only scratches the surface of DeFi utility and NFTs on Mars. NFTs could one day represent ownership of all assets—asteroids, land, real estate, and of course, rocket ships.\nA purposeful future\nToday MartianDAO is a thought experiment, but it could one day be a reality.\nYou’ll notice that I didn’t spend much time in this essay trying to convince you how Mars should be governed. Rather, I focused on the various ways blockchain technology can revolutionize modern governance, given the chance to rebuild.\nOne man’s ideas mean nothing without the support of the people.\nThat said, I welcome the opportunity to start fresh–to correct the past failures of civilization and build a better future for humanity. One where power cannot be concentrated to a handful of players; within a system that cannot be cheated.\nI’m boldly optimistic. Everything I’ve outlined in this essay is technologically feasible today.\nReaching Mars is inevitable. Building a better civilization is up to us.\nIt wouldn't surprise me if people have trouble with these ideas. After all, none of us will see this through in our lifetimes. But the reality is that Earth will not be around forever, and neither will humanity if we do nothing about it.\nGiven the opportunity, we ought to consider that building redundancies for the survival of the species is for the greater good of humanity.\nSurpassing the great filter requires embracing technology to achieve things that we were never before able to do. And to do so without fear–with love and admiration for humankind.\nNotes\n[^1] How to quantify decentralization—MartianDAO will need to use indicators like the Nakamoto coefficient to maintain the optimal level of decentralization for Martian progress.\n[^2] Of course, voters could overrule the constitutional reset with something like a supermajority ruling.\n[^3] \"'The rules to make the rules', an important post by Paul Frazee\" — Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum; tweeted,1.26.22.\n[^4] Interplanetary transfer is possible with the technology we have today. However, there is approximately 20-minutes of latency between data transfers from Earth to Mars. A protocol would likely need to be devised to account for this. However, I imagine that this would be relatively feasible to accomplish without much concern over price changes if such transfers could only be made in the form of stablecoins.\n[^5] e.g., Ethereum Name Service [ENS] governance airdrop, Uniswap airdrop, SOS airdrop, etc.</s>"}

This is interesting because it leaves open the possibility that, in the future, machines will have mental states of their own.\nGiven the recent advancements in computing and artificial intelligence, it is important that we have a philosophy that can account for the possibility of machines not just passing the turning test but, by way of function, have beliefs, desires, and intentions of their own.\nIf functionalism is true, there is no reason to believe that mental states coming from within the head are fundamentally different from mental states that arise from outside the head. They play the same role in cognition.\nIn his paper, Neuroethics and the Extended Mind, Neil Levy goes on to suggest that not all information technologies can be classified as vehicles of mental states. He argues that 1) Wi-Fi isn't always available and 2) the latency between our brains and those systems isn't efficient enough. Yet in the decade since the paper was published, we've significantly reduced that latency.\nInternet connection speed in the United States from 2007 to 2017 (in Mbps)\nStarlink satellites will soon be available worldwide with the potential to provide internet to everyone, anywhere. And in the not-so-distant future, we'll experience the world through brain-machine interface technology, where that latency will cease to exist.\nAlthough we aren't there yet, I would argue that information technology today largely serves as a vehicle of the extended mind. It may not serve people of all kinds, in all contexts, but it does for many.\nMost of us leverage information systems every day to make decisions about our life and work. I for one, could not do my job effectively without them.\nJust like in the thought experiment when you leveraged Google Maps to remember the coffee shop's location, I use Google search to remember syntax for code I write. If my intention is that I have working code, does it matter the vehicle I use to get there?\nNow, consider this same idea but at scale: systems of people utilizing information technology as an extension of mind.\nOrganizations with well-leveraged information systems have the foundations for collective intelligence; an extension of social interactivity and interconnected processes among networks of human nodes. Like an organizational hive mind, the social and technical subsystems[2] of a larger work system have the potential to synthesize.\nThe most effective organizations in the future of work will learn how to make this happen.\nFootnotes:\nActions are not mental states but are often the result of them.\nThe social subsystem refers to the division of labor and methods of coordination used to transform inputs into outputs in an organization. The technical subsystem refers to the tools, systems, and procedures used in that organization's transformation process.</s>"}
