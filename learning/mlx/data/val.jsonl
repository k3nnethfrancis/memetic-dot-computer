[/INST]\ngoverning the red planet\nImagine the year is 2199.\nIt’s been nearly two centuries since the first humans arrived on Mars. The people of Earth have since constructed launch sites, underground scientific labs, and production facilities that operate within an economy of their own. The Mars colonial system is on the verge of self-reliance.\nAs a neutral territory dedicated to the expansion of human civilization, the red planet is governed by a diverse community of colonists who operate without a centralized authority. Colonists are empowered to vote on issues facing the colony and the people of Earth are included in decisions that pertain to humanity. Interplanetary trade and communication are a core part of the Earth-Martian relationship.\nFor people on Earth, the high-risk high-reward asteroid mining industry presents an appealing reason to make the journey. A colonist's family back on Earth would be well cared for thanks to the industry's outsized returns. For the people of Earth, Mars is the Silicon Valley of the 2190s.\nFor many colonists, however, the most appealing factor is the chance at a fresh start—to build a better world for humanity. A world where software enforces decentralized governance at scale, enabling a self-sovereign colonial ecosystem where progress finally gets the incentive structure it deserves.\nThis is the story of MartianDAO.\nAn old problem\nToday, a reasonable debate on the feasibility of colonizing Mars would inevitably arrive at an economic standoff.\nThe most obvious question is, \"how do we pay for it?\"\n…except ‘we’ really means ‘the government,' making things political.\nWhat we ought to be arguing instead is whether governments should be the primary decision-making authority for the future of our civilization.\nAfter all, if Mars is to be a human endeavor. Should it not represent human ideals?\nPolitics blind us from seeing the possible world where governments are not the only funding mechanism for Mars colonization.\nBut the reality is, until now, it was not previously possible to support the kind of collective action and money pooling system needed for this to be a truly planetary effort.\nThis is a seemingly simple requirement on the surface, but a wicked problem under the hood.\nNot only do we need a system for pooling resources and making collective decisions on a planetary scale, but the first task of designing this system leaves humanity in a paradox: how does a society design an economic system that must create and follow its own set of rules without a centralized authority maintaining order?\nAnd if that isn't problematic enough, to be truly fruitful, the system must incentivize continued contributions without creating an unfair monopoly or granting any one party too much control.\nSociety has conditioned us to believe that this type of self-organizing, decentralized system is not possible; that humans are not capable of working together in such a way, never mind at such a scale.\nIf recent history has taught us anything, however, it’s that technology has a funny way of changing the world.\nMartianDAO\nSolving the problem of funding and allocating Mars financials is, of course, not the only thing that makes colonization hard. But without it, nothing else is possible. And there are some clear problems to address.\nIn my view, the path towards achieving the Martian state outlined in the introduction of this essay [let's call it the Martian ideal] is best taken with a decentralized blockchain protocol [^2], effectively making the Mars colonial system a DAO.\nBlockchain provides four core features that make the Martian ideal possible:\nA distributed system: the underlying technology is run on many computers working together to uphold the network.\nDigital currency: money that can be stored and transferred over the internet without a mediating party.\nImmutability: transactions are listed on-chain forever. We can see where they come from, where they go, and where they are held.\nTokenization: the ability to create tokens that can be assigned a value and grant holders certain utilities.\nWhile many other features of a blockchain like non-fungible tokens [NFTs] and on-chain voting mechanisms would be important aspects of the ecosystem as a whole, it is these four core features that make everything else possible.\nAt the foundation, a distributed network of computers ensures the system is resistant to attack and without a need for centralized control. Nodes verifying the network can be built into almost any piece of technology we might use on Mars. Digital currency empowers colonists to transact both with other colonists and the people of Earth efficiently and with minimal bureaucratic restrictions. Immutability ensures accountability, authenticity, and enables public verification. Tokenization extends beyond programmable currency to enable far broader utility and incentives.\nThe rules of the protocol\nGovernance and tokenomics represent the rules of the protocol.\nGovernance defines how decisions are made while tokenomics define the monetary policies of the system. These rules are programmed into smart contracts.\nWhile governance and tokenomics are separate concepts, in a mature system, they would be highly interrelated.\nLet’s consider an example: imagine a law on Mars where colonists pay a land tax. Tokenomics would define how the tax is calculated and could automatically collect by verifying the non-fungible deed to the land in the owner's wallet. If colonists wanted to change the tax rate, governance would define that process with a procedure for submitting a proposal to be voted on by other colonists.\nWhen voting on a proposal, voters will need to consider the optimal amount of decentralization to achieve the Martian ideal. [^1] For example, requiring a 51% majority to change the rules.\nThe ideal governance system may require some experimentation, and system designers must think in terms of centuries–not decades–because the system must include features with implications for the future of Martian civilization such as incentive structure and wealth distribution. As a hedge, developers can program a reset into the Martian constitution after a given number of years has passed. [^2]\nThe process of reviewing and voting on initial proposals at a planetary scale will be one of the most difficult but necessary parts of this process to reach an equitable outcome. This initial method of constitutional proposals is the idea of metagovernance—\"the rules that make the rules.\" [^3]\nOnce a design has been selected, only then should a system be devised for pooling resources that:\n\nallows anyone to contribute\nis capable of interplanetary transfers [^4]\nenables participation in the Martian governance process\n\nPooling money prior would place unnecessary pressure on early contributors.\nWhile the goal is to create a decentralized system, there must be strong enough incentives for people to contribute in the first place. Without an economic incentive motivating behavior, only those with an intrinsic desire to go to Mars will have any vested interest in the state of the Martian colonial system.\nConsider that if MarsCoin is the reserve currency on Mars and the colony becomes self-sustaining and prosperous, it should attract investors and more colonists, pushing up its value. In this model, the same technology that allows you to exchange capital for resources on Mars can be used to invest in the mission as well.\nAdding utility to a token to complement its central purpose as a currency is one of the most promising things about cryptocurrency. For example, we could design a system where voting power is a function of the amount of MarsCoin one purchases. Alternatively, we could take a retroactive approach to incentivize engineering by airdropping a separate class of governance tokens after users make contributions to the system. [^5] In fact, we could develop as many derivatives of MarsCoin as we need, each with a different purpose, like stablecoins or reputation tokens, each of which could add value to the ecosystem in its own ways.\nThe limits for a well-tokenized system to incentivize progress might seem endless, but designing digital infrastructure underlying a planetary socioeconomic system can have unintended consequences. Tokenomics must be considered with absolute scrutiny if the goal is to achieve [and maintain] the Martian ideal.\nIt is far more difficult to fix an unjust system than it is to design one that is just to begin with.\nWhile there are many pitfalls in tokenomics designs that can go unforeseen before a system reaches critical mass, governance is the critical factor for maintaining decentralization in the long run. And the list of governance pitfalls is no shorter.\nWe should take lessons from current experiments and their outcomes. ENS for example implemented a governance system where one can delegate their votes to a trusted party, but when a few trusted parties maintain a majority of votes, we are effectively centralizing the system.\nMoreover, if governance and tokenomics are too intertwined, such that power is too closely correlated with the total amount of MarsCoin one holds and there are no measures in place to cap one’s governance power, we may risk centralized parties emerging with a disproportionate amount of decision-making power. This is contradictory to the ideals of decentralization.\nAddressing this is difficult. Because of human nature, there may always be conflicting and communal interests that lead to lobby-like behavior. However, since not everyone can physically contribute, it will be hard to incentivize financial contributions without putting some weight on monetary contributions as a path to having a say in humanity’s future.\nLuckily, in a world of programmable money, distributive justice is just a few more lines of code.\nSome ideas:\n\nA colonist-contributor split: for every MarsCoin minted on the blockchain, an additional MarsCoin is minted into a locked Martian treasury. These coins will ensure that colonists always have 50% governance power, but the coins will never be used for making transactions to retain supply scarcity.\nGovernance utility caps: no matter how many coins an individual entity holds, they will never be granted more than 5% of the available voting power.\nStochastic parliament: using a random number generator, parliament members could be nominated at random from the colony. The colony could then choose who they’d like to delegate their governance tokens to over the term, which would then be locked until the following term.\n\nI'm by no means an economist and there are far better ideas out there. It’s probably a smart decision to avoid designing a system where the reserve currency is tied to policy-making decisions in the first place. But maybe not always. I simply aim to demonstrate how different incentive mechanisms can be built into a systems design.\nThere are limitless possibilities for designing the hyperstructures that power the Martian ideal. This kind of smart-contract-based system would run forever, for no cost other than the energy to run the network, without maintenance or downtime.\nWhat’s beautiful about this system is that in the future, if there is majority agreement, it can be updated. To change the rules of society with a pull request is a revolutionary way to change the world.\nDAOs' unique applications further extend to the way they reward their members. Decentralized finance [DeFi] protocols enable novel reward mechanisms like staking, while NFTs can be used to unlock token gated rewards for their holders. Staking works by locking up your investment within a protocol. In return, you're offered interest for providing the protocol liquidity.\nStaking could offer a unique way for colonists and contributors to leverage their capital while ensuring enough liquidity to keep critical projects moving.\nThe asteroid mining industry could leverage NFTs to grant a stake in certain asteroids on the belt. These asteroids are to some degree a gamble, but a lucky draw could mean generational wealth.\nThen, asteroid NFT holders could stake their asteroids to effectively lease them out to miners. They could then mine them for resources while owners are paid out in fees.\nThis only scratches the surface of DeFi utility and NFTs on Mars. NFTs could one day represent ownership of all assets—asteroids, land, real estate, and of course, rocket ships.\nA purposeful future\nToday MartianDAO is a thought experiment, but it could one day be a reality.\nYou’ll notice that I didn’t spend much time in this essay trying to convince you how Mars should be governed. Rather, I focused on the various ways blockchain technology can revolutionize modern governance, given the chance to rebuild.\nOne man’s ideas mean nothing without the support of the people.\nThat said, I welcome the opportunity to start fresh–to correct the past failures of civilization and build a better future for humanity. One where power cannot be concentrated to a handful of players; within a system that cannot be cheated.\nI’m boldly optimistic. Everything I’ve outlined in this essay is technologically feasible today.\nReaching Mars is inevitable. Building a better civilization is up to us.\nIt wouldn't surprise me if people have trouble with these ideas. After all, none of us will see this through in our lifetimes. But the reality is that Earth will not be around forever, and neither will humanity if we do nothing about it.\nGiven the opportunity, we ought to consider that building redundancies for the survival of the species is for the greater good of humanity.\nSurpassing the great filter requires embracing technology to achieve things that we were never before able to do. And to do so without fear–with love and admiration for humankind.\nNotes\n[^1] How to quantify decentralization—MartianDAO will need to use indicators like the Nakamoto coefficient to maintain the optimal level of decentralization for Martian progress.\n[^2] Of course, voters could overrule the constitutional reset with something like a supermajority ruling.\n[^3] \"'The rules to make the rules', an important post by Paul Frazee\" — Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum; tweeted,1.26.22.\n[^4] Interplanetary transfer is possible with the technology we have today.

[/INST]\ntaking gpt-4 out of the box\nMicrosoft researchers claim OpenAI's latest model has the 'sparks of AGI'. I think when we look back at this time it will seem obvious. It probably won't ever be clear-cut, but GPT-4's capacity to generalize over almost anything in the form of text doesn't look like narrow intelligence to me. At the same time, it's possible that stacking more layers onto the underlying neural network might not be needed for fully realizing artificial general intelligence.\nMicrosoft researchers, in their extensive paper, \"Sparks of artificial general intelligence: early experiments with GPT-4,\" [^1] make a compelling case for why GPT-4 may have crossed a key threshold.\n[If you are skeptical of these claims and haven't read or skimmed it, I would suggest at least watching this to get up to speed.]\nThe experiments they conducted, however, all occurred inside GPT-4's box. That is, they chatted with GPT-4 but did not integrate it with external systems. They, rightfully, assessed its base intelligence.\nIn this essay, I'll explore the engineering paradigms aimed at taking GPT-4 out of its box and augmenting its intelligence. In effect, this allows us to build AI systems capable of operating in the world and generalizing to a growing set of domains. As this paradigm continues to develop, we'll eventually achieve PASTA: a process for automating scientific and technological advancement [^2], for which we'll look at some early signs. I'll conclude with a brief discussion on the implications for AI safety.\nKey limitations of the base model: Does GPT-4 Need a System II?\nMicrosoft's research highlights GPT-4's inability to plan as a key limitation of its intelligence. I think this is an important point because their consensus definition of intelligence [^3] explicitly includes planning ability. In this sense, GPT-4 falls short.\nThat said, this perspective might be limiting. To draw an analogy, consider Daniel Kahneman's two modes of thought: System 1 and System 2.\nSystem 1 is characterized as fast, intuitive, and automatic, while System 2 is slower, deliberate, and analytical. We can think of GPT-4's inability to plan as a problem with its confinement as a System 1 machine, excelling in rapid cognition but struggling with planning and reasoning, which are hallmarks of System 2 thinking [^4].\nMy guess is this has to do with GPT models being autoregressive transformers, able to use context and self-attention to predict the next token but unable to produce a final state without first achieving all prior states. In other words, planning requires backwards-reasoning, which is contradictory to the nature of the underlying architecture.\nThe question arises: can we engineer a pseudo-System II for GPT-4?\nIntelligence augmentation: getting out of the box\nAs of today, there seem to be three major paradigms for augmenting GPT-4's intelligence and taking it out of the box. These are: context injection, recursive prompting, and toolformers. I explain these in more detail below. From them, many other applications are possible from simulations and self-correcting systems to autonomous agents; all of which can be built with an OpenAI API key and a recent version of Python installed.\nContext injection involves processing document embeddings, storing them in a vector database, and semantically searching over them to query more relevant information given a prompt. When applied to GPT-4, this looks like modifying the prompt with additional context to produce better responses. Context injection can also be used to provide external memory stores for GPT-4, allowing it to remember things far outside its context window.\nsource: pinecone\nRecursive prompting involves having GPT-4 loop over its previous context, possibly using another model to summarize it or pick out key relevant points, and then using context injection to add that to the next prompt. This process is repeated until it reaches a final answer to a question or task. This process can be built up from a System 1 machine to a coherent planning system, even if the base model itself isn't responsible for the entirety of the process.\nsource: yohei nakajima\nToolformers are transformer models that can use tools. It is a term coined by Meta AI researchers in their paper \"Toolformer: language models can teach themselves to use tools\" [^5] to describe the process of teaching transformer models to call APIs with natural language. In effect, this enables LLMs to execute arbitrary tasks on the condition they can be executed via an API call.\nCombined, recursive prompting and context injection effectively form a pseudo-system 2 for GPT-4. While toolformers, on the other hand, represent the final reagent for developing AI systems that can operate in the world.\nAgent systems: from thinkers to doers\nEarly agent systems work by wrapping a pseudo-system 2 around the base model. By recursively prompting GPT-4 and injecting relevant context from external memory stores, we get plans, subgoals, and tasks as output.\nIt turns out the implementation for this is fairly simple too, as demonstrated with babyAGI, a project by Yohei Nakajima who did it with 138 lines of Python code.\nIf that wasn't impressive [or concerning] enough, the part of the program that runs the recursive loop is only 35 lines:\nAt the time of me writing this, Yohei has released an update that enables babyAGI to execute on these tasks using APIs as tools. There is also LangChain, a popular Python library for building applications with LLMs, with a page dedicated to the implementation of agents including Python notebook tutorials on babyAGI and AutoGPT—another popular implementation.\nIn my view, these early agentGPT systems have clearly demonstrated planning abilities. But their implications just keep unfolding. It's one thing to have an agent that can make plans, but an entirely different thing when the agent can execute tasks, which is exactly what toolformers enable. OpenAI's recent launch of ChatGPT plugins should serve as confirmation that the floodgates to a world of possibilities have been opened.\nResearch agents\nThe application space I'm most excited about is research: agentic AI systems designed to conduct parts or all of a research work stream. One project by Eimen Hamedat called autoresearcher is an early example. Autoresearcher takes a research question and searches Semantic Scholar for relevant papers, summarizes them, then synthesizes it all in a final output.\nWhile still a rather simple system, it's clear that automating the process of literature reviews could save enormous amounts of time. But other parts of the scientific research process are far more complex, and I could see how, to some people, fully automating the process might seem like a long shot.\nConsider a recent paper titled, \"Emergent autonomous scientific research capabilities of large language models\" [^6], which demonstrated how GPT-4 was able to plan and leverage tools to conduct a chemistry experiment. This work from Carnegie Mellon's Chemistry department, in my view, may have the sparks for PASTA—Process for Automating Scientific and Technological Advancement—a term coined by Holden Karnofsky, in his blog, Cold Takes.\nI was blown away by this. To me, PASTA represents the holy grail. But there is still plenty of work to do. For one, APIs don't exist for conducting any arbitrary scientific experiment. Scientists and researchers who want to integrate AI into their workflows will have to build API wrappers around their stack, assuming they are writing code for their work, which represents another hurdle that science has yet to overcome. Though automation is a great economic incentive and I think it's likely that it pushes scientific research towards this direction. There are fields like chemistry and biology that tend to be more adapted to these tools, which I think will serve as examples for other scientific disciplines.\nLike the rest of science as it adopts these tools, things will start off slow; first by automating low-hanging-fruit tasks then by compounding those automations. Automated scientific research and discovery will accelerate human progress at a rate unimaginable to us today. This could mean curing all diseases, solving the climate crisis, free energy, and colonies on Mars. While there is plenty of hope for what we could achieve if things go well, the reality is there's loads of uncertainty too. Things going wrong could mean serious consequences for humanity. [^7]\nDoing this safely\nBuilding AI systems that can pursue goals reliably in the world isn't trivial, but it doesn't seem like we'll be able to keep people from developing them. As pointed out by Zvi, the development of agent systems comes with important safety concerns.\nA critical issue lies in determining when we cross the threshold into dangerous territory: when do these AI systems become unsafe? A confined GPT-4 model may not seem threatening, but once it starts operating autonomously and engaging with the world through APIs, the potential for harm can't be ignored. Malicious users may design systems with harmful goals or even well-intended, unmonitored systems may unintentionally produce harmful subgoals. With economic incentives high, we should expect many agents to be developed over the next several years, with most being designed for good intent but a substantial number built for nefarious purposes like phishing scams and propaganda machines.\nOn the other hand, agent systems have the potential to help solve key problems in AI safety research. For instance, using agent-based simulations could allow researchers to test the risks and limitations of these systems in a safe environment before deploying them in the wild. Agents systems have also been proposed as solutions to alignment, such Iterated Distillation and Amplification (IDA), which propose a multi-agent system that recursively aligns itself with the help of other agents [^9]. I am hopeful about both of these lines of research.\nWeighing the risks and benefits, there seem to be good reasons to be optimistic. I expect base models like GPT-4 to be sufficiently aligned by their governing organizations such as OpenAI, limiting the possibilities for harmful outcomes. However, as models become more powerful or reinforcement learning unintentionally optimizes for undesirable outcomes, the base model's alignment may become less reliable, especially when giving the AI a pseudo-system 2 and taking it out of the box.\nFortunately, these are programs that can be monitored and intervened upon if they exhibit harmful behavior. Since many AI systems rely on APIs, we can expect organizations like OpenAI and other organizations to engage in proactive monitoring and take necessary precautions. That said, if open source models start to become powerful enough, we may no longer be able to rely on corporations to help monitor misuse.\nUltimately, AI agent systems have the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, but their development must be pursued with a keen eye on safety. If you are developing these systems, you have a responsibility to the human race to exercise caution and minimize harm. These are crucial steps we must take in harnessing the benefits of what may be the most important technology we have ever created.\nNotes\n[^1] Bubeck, S., Chandrasekaran, V., Eldan, R., Gehrke, J., Horvitz, E., Kamar, E., ... & Zhang, Y.

{"text": "<s>[INST] Explain this point from the blog post 'Extended Mind': The parity principle argues that vehicles for mental states (such as tools and systems) make no difference, only their functionality matters. [/INST]\nwork systems and the extended mind\nAs it turns out, On information technology was a discussion of the extended mind hypothesis.\nThis is the idea that the mind is not limited to the inside of the head. But rather, we leverage systems and tools to extend our minds outside of the head, into the world.\nConsider the following thought experiment:\nSuppose you and a friend are meeting for coffee. Your friend remembers that the coffee shop is on Smith Street, so he hops in his car and drives himself over. You've been to the coffee shop before, but it's been a while, so you'll need to look it up on your phone first. Once Google Maps reminds you of its location on Smith Street, you hop in your car and drive yourself over.\nIs there any relevant difference between the mental states you and your friend arrived at?\nBefore answering this, let's first define a mental state: a condition of the mind which has content, typically expressed in \"that\" statements, corresponding to thoughts and feelings.\nFor example, the belief that I am writing, the desire that I convey this information clearly, or the intention that I publish this in May.\nFrom mental states, we are able to arrive at a proposition–an attitude, argument, theory, proposal, etc., which may lead to actions[1].\nIn our thought experiment, both parties arrive at the same mental state–the belief that the coffee shop is located on Smith street. Of course, there are differences in the way that mental state was reached, but that is less a matter of mental state than it is a matter of vehicle.\nAll mental states need vehicles–a means to arrive at said mental state. In conventional philosophy (i.e., the identity thesis), the vehicles of mental states are neural states. For the extended mind hypothesis, vehicles can exist outside of the mind: a notebook, a smartphone, or another information system.\nThe extended mind hypothesis says that the vehicle in which you arrive at a mental state makes no difference. All that matters in defining a mental state is that it functions as one. This is known as the parity principle and is a fundamental argument for functionalism.\nFunctionalism posits that mental states are mental states regardless if they arise from flesh or metal or silicon. This is interesting because it leaves open the possibility that, in the future, machines will have mental states of their own.\nGiven the recent advancements in computing and artificial intelligence, it is important that we have a philosophy that can account for the possibility of machines not just passing the turning test but, by way of function, have beliefs, desires, and intentions of their own.\nIf functionalism is true, there is no reason to believe that mental states coming from within the head are fundamentally different from mental states that arise from outside the head. They play the same role in cognition.\nIn his paper, Neuroethics and the Extended Mind, Neil Levy goes on to suggest that not all information technologies can be classified as vehicles of mental states. He argues that 1) Wi-Fi isn't always available and 2) the latency between our brains and those systems isn't efficient enough. Yet in the decade since the paper was published, we've significantly reduced that latency.\nInternet connection speed in the United States from 2007 to 2017 (in Mbps)\nStarlink satellites will soon be available worldwide with the potential to provide internet to everyone, anywhere. And in the not-so-distant future, we'll experience the world through brain-machine interface technology, where that latency will cease to exist.\nAlthough we aren't there yet, I would argue that information technology today largely serves as a vehicle of the extended mind. It may not serve people of all kinds, in all contexts, but it does for many.\nMost of us leverage information systems every day to make decisions about our life and work. I for one, could not do my job effectively without them.\nJust like in the thought experiment when you leveraged Google Maps to remember the coffee shop's location, I use Google search to remember syntax for code I write. If my intention is that I have working code, does it matter the vehicle I use to get there?\nNow, consider this same idea but at scale: systems of people utilizing information technology as an extension of mind.\nOrganizations with well-leveraged information systems have the foundations for collective intelligence; an extension of social interactivity and interconnected processes among networks of human nodes. Like an organizational hive mind, the social and technical subsystems[2] of a larger work system have the potential to synthesize.\nThe most effective organizations in the future of work will learn how to make this happen.\nFootnotes:\nActions are not mental states but are often the result of them.\nThe social subsystem refers to the division of labor and methods of coordination used to transform inputs into outputs in an organization. The technical subsystem refers to the tools, systems, and procedures used in that organization's transformation process.</s>"}

{"text": "<s>[INST] Explain this point from the blog post 'Governing The Red Planet': Governance and tokenomics are separate concepts that are highly interrelated in a mature system. [/INST]\ngoverning the red planet\nImagine the year is 2199.\nIt’s been nearly two centuries since the first humans arrived on Mars. The people of Earth have since constructed launch sites, underground scientific labs, and production facilities that operate within an economy of their own. The Mars colonial system is on the verge of self-reliance.\nAs a neutral territory dedicated to the expansion of human civilization, the red planet is governed by a diverse community of colonists who operate without a centralized authority. Colonists are empowered to vote on issues facing the colony and the people of Earth are included in decisions that pertain to humanity. Interplanetary trade and communication are a core part of the Earth-Martian relationship.\nFor people on Earth, the high-risk high-reward asteroid mining industry presents an appealing reason to make the journey. A colonist's family back on Earth would be well cared for thanks to the industry's outsized returns. For the people of Earth, Mars is the Silicon Valley of the 2190s.\nFor many colonists, however, the most appealing factor is the chance at a fresh start—to build a better world for humanity. A world where software enforces decentralized governance at scale, enabling a self-sovereign colonial ecosystem where progress finally gets the incentive structure it deserves.\nThis is the story of MartianDAO.\nAn old problem\nToday, a reasonable debate on the feasibility of colonizing Mars would inevitably arrive at an economic standoff.\nThe most obvious question is, \"how do we pay for it?\"\n…except ‘we’ really means ‘the government,' making things political.\nWhat we ought to be arguing instead is whether governments should be the primary decision-making authority for the future of our civilization.\nAfter all, if Mars is to be a human endeavor. Should it not represent human ideals?\nPolitics blind us from seeing the possible world where governments are not the only funding mechanism for Mars colonization.\nBut the reality is, until now, it was not previously possible to support the kind of collective action and money pooling system needed for this to be a truly planetary effort.\nThis is a seemingly simple requirement on the surface, but a wicked problem under the hood.\nNot only do we need a system for pooling resources and making collective decisions on a planetary scale, but the first task of designing this system leaves humanity in a paradox: how does a society design an economic system that must create and follow its own set of rules without a centralized authority maintaining order?\nAnd if that isn't problematic enough, to be truly fruitful, the system must incentivize continued contributions without creating an unfair monopoly or granting any one party too much control.\nSociety has conditioned us to believe that this type of self-organizing, decentralized system is not possible; that humans are not capable of working together in such a way, never mind at such a scale.\nIf recent history has taught us anything, however, it’s that technology has a funny way of changing the world.\nMartianDAO\nSolving the problem of funding and allocating Mars financials is, of course, not the only thing that makes colonization hard. But without it, nothing else is possible. And there are some clear problems to address.\nIn my view, the path towards achieving the Martian state outlined in the introduction of this essay [let's call it the Martian ideal] is best taken with a decentralized blockchain protocol [^2], effectively making the Mars colonial system a DAO.\nBlockchain provides four core features that make the Martian ideal possible:\nA distributed system: the underlying technology is run on many computers working together to uphold the network.\nDigital currency: money that can be stored and transferred over the internet without a mediating party.\nImmutability: transactions are listed on-chain forever. We can see where they come from, where they go, and where they are held.\nTokenization: the ability to create tokens that can be assigned a value and grant holders certain utilities.\nWhile many other features of a blockchain like non-fungible tokens [NFTs] and on-chain voting mechanisms would be important aspects of the ecosystem as a whole, it is these four core features that make everything else possible.\nAt the foundation, a distributed network of computers ensures the system is resistant to attack and without a need for centralized control. Nodes verifying the network can be built into almost any piece of technology we might use on Mars. Digital currency empowers colonists to transact both with other colonists and the people of Earth efficiently and with minimal bureaucratic restrictions. Immutability ensures accountability, authenticity, and enables public verification. Tokenization extends beyond programmable currency to enable far broader utility and incentives.\nThe rules of the protocol\nGovernance and tokenomics represent the rules of the protocol.\nGovernance defines how decisions are made while tokenomics define the monetary policies of the system. These rules are programmed into smart contracts.\nWhile governance and tokenomics are separate concepts, in a mature system, they would be highly interrelated.\nLet’s consider an example: imagine a law on Mars where colonists pay a land tax. Tokenomics would define how the tax is calculated and could automatically collect by verifying the non-fungible deed to the land in the owner's wallet. If colonists wanted to change the tax rate, governance would define that process with a procedure for submitting a proposal to be voted on by other colonists.\nWhen voting on a proposal, voters will need to consider the optimal amount of decentralization to achieve the Martian ideal. [^1] For example, requiring a 51% majority to change the rules.\nThe ideal governance system may require some experimentation, and system designers must think in terms of centuries–not decades–because the system must include features with implications for the future of Martian civilization such as incentive structure and wealth distribution. As a hedge, developers can program a reset into the Martian constitution after a given number of years has passed. [^2]\nThe process of reviewing and voting on initial proposals at a planetary scale will be one of the most difficult but necessary parts of this process to reach an equitable outcome. This initial method of constitutional proposals is the idea of metagovernance—\"the rules that make the rules.\" [^3]\nOnce a design has been selected, only then should a system be devised for pooling resources that:\n\nallows anyone to contribute\nis capable of interplanetary transfers [^4]\nenables participation in the Martian governance process\n\nPooling money prior would place unnecessary pressure on early contributors.\nWhile the goal is to create a decentralized system, there must be strong enough incentives for people to contribute in the first place. Without an economic incentive motivating behavior, only those with an intrinsic desire to go to Mars will have any vested interest in the state of the Martian colonial system.\nConsider that if MarsCoin is the reserve currency on Mars and the colony becomes self-sustaining and prosperous, it should attract investors and more colonists, pushing up its value. In this model, the same technology that allows you to exchange capital for resources on Mars can be used to invest in the mission as well.\nAdding utility to a token to complement its central purpose as a currency is one of the most promising things about cryptocurrency. For example, we could design a system where voting power is a function of the amount of MarsCoin one purchases. Alternatively, we could take a retroactive approach to incentivize engineering by airdropping a separate class of governance tokens after users make contributions to the system. [^5] In fact, we could develop as many derivatives of MarsCoin as we need, each with a different purpose, like stablecoins or reputation tokens, each of which could add value to the ecosystem in its own ways.\nThe limits for a well-tokenized system to incentivize progress might seem endless, but designing digital infrastructure underlying a planetary socioeconomic system can have unintended consequences. Tokenomics must be considered with absolute scrutiny if the goal is to achieve [and maintain] the Martian ideal.\nIt is far more difficult to fix an unjust system than it is to design one that is just to begin with.\nWhile there are many pitfalls in tokenomics designs that can go unforeseen before a system reaches critical mass, governance is the critical factor for maintaining decentralization in the long run. And the list of governance pitfalls is no shorter.\nWe should take lessons from current experiments and their outcomes. ENS for example implemented a governance system where one can delegate their votes to a trusted party, but when a few trusted parties maintain a majority of votes, we are effectively centralizing the system.\nMoreover, if governance and tokenomics are too intertwined, such that power is too closely correlated with the total amount of MarsCoin one holds and there are no measures in place to cap one’s governance power, we may risk centralized parties emerging with a disproportionate amount of decision-making power. This is contradictory to the ideals of decentralization.\nAddressing this is difficult. Because of human nature, there may always be conflicting and communal interests that lead to lobby-like behavior. However, since not everyone can physically contribute, it will be hard to incentivize financial contributions without putting some weight on monetary contributions as a path to having a say in humanity’s future.\nLuckily, in a world of programmable money, distributive justice is just a few more lines of code.\nSome ideas:\n\nA colonist-contributor split: for every MarsCoin minted on the blockchain, an additional MarsCoin is minted into a locked Martian treasury. These coins will ensure that colonists always have 50% governance power, but the coins will never be used for making transactions to retain supply scarcity.\nGovernance utility caps: no matter how many coins an individual entity holds, they will never be granted more than 5% of the available voting power.\nStochastic parliament: using a random number generator, parliament members could be nominated at random from the colony. The colony could then choose who they’d like to delegate their governance tokens to over the term, which would then be locked until the following term.\n\nI'm by no means an economist and there are far better ideas out there. It’s probably a smart decision to avoid designing a system where the reserve currency is tied to policy-making decisions in the first place. But maybe not always. I simply aim to demonstrate how different incentive mechanisms can be built into a systems design.\nThere are limitless possibilities for designing the hyperstructures that power the Martian ideal. This kind of smart-contract-based system would run forever, for no cost other than the energy to run the network, without maintenance or downtime.\nWhat’s beautiful about this system is that in the future, if there is majority agreement, it can be updated. To change the rules of society with a pull request is a revolutionary way to change the world.\nDAOs' unique applications further extend to the way they reward their members. Decentralized finance [DeFi] protocols enable novel reward mechanisms like staking, while NFTs can be used to unlock token gated rewards for their holders. Staking works by locking up your investment within a protocol. In return, you're offered interest for providing the protocol liquidity.\nStaking could offer a unique way for colonists and contributors to leverage their capital while ensuring enough liquidity to keep critical projects moving.\nThe asteroid mining industry could leverage NFTs to grant a stake in certain asteroids on the belt. These asteroids are to some degree a gamble, but a lucky draw could mean generational wealth.\nThen, asteroid NFT holders could stake their asteroids to effectively lease them out to miners. They could then mine them for resources while owners are paid out in fees.\nThis only scratches the surface of DeFi utility and NFTs on Mars. NFTs could one day represent ownership of all assets—asteroids, land, real estate, and of course, rocket ships.\nA purposeful future\nToday MartianDAO is a thought experiment, but it could one day be a reality.\nYou’ll notice that I didn’t spend much time in this essay trying to convince you how Mars should be governed. Rather, I focused on the various ways blockchain technology can revolutionize modern governance, given the chance to rebuild.\nOne man’s ideas mean nothing without the support of the people.\nThat said, I welcome the opportunity to start fresh–to correct the past failures of civilization and build a better future for humanity. One where power cannot be concentrated to a handful of players; within a system that cannot be cheated.\nI’m boldly optimistic. Everything I’ve outlined in this essay is technologically feasible today.\nReaching Mars is inevitable. Building a better civilization is up to us.\nIt wouldn't surprise me if people have trouble with these ideas. After all, none of us will see this through in our lifetimes. But the reality is that Earth will not be around forever, and neither will humanity if we do nothing about it.\nGiven the opportunity, we ought to consider that building redundancies for the survival of the species is for the greater good of humanity.\nSurpassing the great filter requires embracing technology to achieve things that we were never before able to do. And to do so without fear–with love and admiration for humankind.\nNotes\n[^1] How to quantify decentralization—MartianDAO will need to use indicators like the Nakamoto coefficient to maintain the optimal level of decentralization for Martian progress.\n[^2] Of course, voters could overrule the constitutional reset with something like a supermajority ruling.\n[^3] \"'The rules to make the rules', an important post by Paul Frazee\" — Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum; tweeted,1.26.22.\n[^4] Interplanetary transfer is possible with the technology we have today. However, there is approximately 20-minutes of latency between data transfers from Earth to Mars. A protocol would likely need to be devised to account for this. However, I imagine that this would be relatively feasible to accomplish without much concern over price changes if such transfers could only be made in the form of stablecoins.\n[^5] e.g., Ethereum Name Service [ENS] governance airdrop, Uniswap airdrop, SOS airdrop, etc.</s>"}
